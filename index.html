<h2>Digital Learning Hub, UNSW Art & Design</h2>
<p>Welcome to the IML github, a home for code, documentation and other information relating to the Interactive Media Lab at UNSW Art & Design. </p>
<p>We will be using this page as a hub to link to other locations and repositories where students will be able to find specific code examples, walkthroughs and in-depth tutorials, as support for various courses and student projects.</p>

<h3>Arduino</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.arduino.cc">Arduino</a> is a programmable microcontroller which allows artists and makers to incorporate sensors, motors, lights and other electronics into creative projects.</p>
<p>The IML github hosts walkthrough repositories explaining how to get Arduino set up in conjunction with <a href="https://github.com/iml-unsw/arduinomax">Max</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iml-unsw/arduinoprocessing">Processing</a>, in addition to running beginners Arduino workshops during term time. There is also an introductory Arduino badge coming to my.artdesign soon.</p>
<p>For students who are inexperienced with Arduino, we recommend reading through our <a href="https://github.com/iml-unsw/arduinochecklist">Arduino Project Checklist</a> prior to commencing work, as it will provide some valuable tips on where to buy components, how to find libraries, and the different environments in which you can work on your project.</p>

<h3>Max</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.cycling74.com">Max</a>, sometimes referred to as "Max/MSP", is a visual programming environment, where <i>objects</i> are connected to one another with <i>patch cables</i>. Each object completes simple tasks, such as combining two numbers, sending trigger outputs, or playing and manipulating audio, which is one of Max's major strengths. Max also has excellent documentation, which is accessible by right clicking on any object and opening its help or reference file. </p>
<p>As above, there are repositories on the IML github for using Max with Arduino, in addition to an <a href="https://github.com/iml-unsw/KinectOSC">example which receives location data from a Kinect via a Processing sketch</a>.</p>
<p>Max is not free. While all lab computers on campus have it installed, if students intend to use it on their personal computers, they must purchase a license through the Cycling74 website. There is a free 30 day trial, but once it has expired you will no longer be able to save your work.</p>


<h3>Processing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.processing.org">Processing</a> is a free, open source programming environment designed to teach the foundations of computation through creativity. It has excellent documentation, a highly engaged online community, and its functionality can be greatly expanded beyond images and animation through use of <i>libraries</i>. Processing is taught or used in various Media Arts and Design stream modules at UNSW Art & Design, and the IML also runs introductory workshops during term time.</p>
<p>If you're just getting started with text-based programming, Processing is a perfect way to learn. Have a look at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/shiffman/playlists?view=50&sort=dd&shelf_id=2">Daniel Shiffman's Learning Processing: A Beginner's Guide to Programming Images, Animation and Interaction</a> video series.
